    text: This is a free pack, which means we get over a 100 downloads per month,
      we most certainly won't be able to help you through your Unity learning process
      other than providing this pack for free as we need to dedicate our resources
      for our other packs and for our paid products, but if you have tips on how to
      improve this pack you can always check our forum thread. Thanks.
